                                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
